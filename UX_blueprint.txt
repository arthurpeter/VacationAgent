1️⃣ Discovery Screen (Chat Interface)

Goal: Understand user preferences in a conversational manner.

Features:

Chat input: User types or selects from suggestions.

AI questions: Dynamically ask about:

Vibe (beach, city, adventure, etc.)

Activities (waterparks, amusement parks, museums)

Budget

Dates or season

Number of travelers

Departure location

Progress summary panel: Shows filled slots and missing info.

Skip/guess options: AI can suggest defaults if user is unsure.

AI logic:

Stores minimal state object with slots:

{
  "vibe": "beach",
  "activities": ["waterpark", "amusement park"],
  "budget": 2000,
  "dates": {"start": "2025-09-15", "end": "2025-09-22"},
  "travelers": 2,
  "departure": "Bucharest"
}


Determines when enough info is collected to move to the next screen.

UX note:

Users should see suggestions inline but retain control.

Visual cue when AI thinks the discovery phase is complete.

Transition:

Once mandatory slots are filled → CTA: “See Your Vacation Options” → moves to Options Screen.
